The application allows users to rent a car, as follows:
· To register (necessary step)
· To view the available car (there is additional information for each car)
· To sort the offered car models (by price and car brand)
· After choosing the car model, they choose the location, dates, and times of car collection and return
· Thanks to HyGraph CMS, it is possible to replace car data with others. Car Rental App is created using React, NextJs, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, HyGraph, Typescript, and Clerk.
